# About the project
This project represents a subset of generic online store functionality related to retrieving product categories and products associated with them. The app generates 10 000 fake products accross 5 categories on startup and exposes endpoints to get the data. For me, the goals for these projects were to:
- Try out the Bogus library to generate fake data
- Use Entity Framework Core for data access
- Explore ways to provide pagination, sorting, filtering and search functionality in the endpoint used to retrieve products in a category. 
- Use .NET Minimal API instead of controllers

## Running the app
To try out the app:
1. Clone the repo
2. Insert a connection string for an SQL database server in appsettings.json, I've tested the app with Postgres
3. Build & run the app
4. On startup the app will create a database and populate the tables with categories and products generated by Bogus
5. Call the endpoints as described in the [docs](docs/Endpoints)
